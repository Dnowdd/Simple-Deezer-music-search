# Simple Music Search in Deezer API *(via: Rapid API)*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About.
This is a simple school project that searches the Deezer app API for songs from around the world.

This API is made available through [RapidAPI](rapidapi.com), which provides us with a search facility.
  

## How to run the App.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs node modules to run the application.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

Now, in App.js you need add your [RapidAPI](rapidapi.com) key.
